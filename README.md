# Clojure Live Reload HTML Server Template

Automatic reload for Clojure server rendered HTML.

This template will generate a minimal starting point for a clojure server that
serves HTML (created from Hiccup) and CSS files and will have your browser
perform a Figwheel/Shadow-like live reload without the need to tab over to your
browser when your clojure code is re-evaluated or your CSS files are saved.

## Usage

This is a template project for use with [deps-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/deps-new).

To use it first make sure you have installed `deps-new` as your `new` "tool" via:

```bash
clojure -Ttools install io.github.seancorfield/deps-new '{:git/tag "v0.4.13"}' :as new
```

Then run:

``` bash
    $ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {net.clojars.afrey/html-server-live-reload-template {:mv/version "VERSION"}}}' -Tnew create :template afrey/html_server_live_reload_template :name yourcorp/app-name
```
